In this paper, we address for the first time the problem of searching the Panama Papers for people and companies that may be involved in illegal acts. We use a collection of international blacklists of sanctioned people and organizations as ground truth for bad entities. We propose a new ranking algorithm, named Suspiciousness Rank Back and Forth (SRBF), that leverages this ground truth to assign a degree of suspiciousness to each entity in the Panama Papers. We experimentally show that our algorithm achieves an AUROC of 0.85 and an Area Under the Recall Curve of 0.87 and outperforms existing techniques.","tags":[],"title":"Inferring Bad Entities Through the Panama Papers Network.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Edoardo Serra","Ashish Sharma","Mikel Joaristi","Oxana Korzh"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1535414400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535414400,"objectID":"8010b62e33072746cad396a454f76047","permalink":"https://mjoaristi.github.io/publication/unknown-landscape-identification-with-cnn-transfer-learning/","publishdate":"2018-08-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/unknown-landscape-identification-with-cnn-transfer-learning/","section":"publication","summary":"Unknown landscape identification is the problem of identifying an unknown landscape from a set of already provided landscape images that are considered to be known. The aim of this work is to extract the intrinsic semantic of landscape images in order to automatically generalize concepts like a stadium, roads, a parking lot etc., and use this concept to identify unknown landscapes. This problem can be easily extended to many security applications. We propose two effective semi-supervised novelty detection approaches for the unknown landscape identification problem using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Transfer Learning. This is based on the use of pre-trained CNNs (i.e. already trained on large datasets) already containing general image knowledge that we transfer to our domain. Our best values of AUROC and Average Precision scores for the identification problem are 0.96 and 0.94, respectively. In addition, we statistically prove that our semi-supervised methods outperform the baseline.","tags":[],"title":"Unknown Landscape Identification With CNN Transfer Learning.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oxana Korzh","Mikel Joaristi","Edoardo Serra"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1529884800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529884800,"objectID":"45d383327beaeda28cd2883d35269ed8","permalink":"https://mjoaristi.github.io/publication/convolutional-neural-network-ensemble-fine-tuning-for-extended-transfer-learning/","publishdate":"2018-06-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/convolutional-neural-network-ensemble-fine-tuning-for-extended-transfer-learning/","section":"publication","summary":"Nowadays, image classification is a core task for many high impact applications such as object recognition, self-driving cars, national security (border monitoring, assault detection), safety (fire detection, distracted driving), geo-monitoring (cloud, rock and crop-disease detection). Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) are effective for those applications. However, they need to be trained with a huge number of examples and a consequently huge training time. Unfortunately, when the training set is not big enough and when re-train the model several times is needed, a common approach is to adopt a transfer learning procedure. Transfer learning procedures use networks already pretrained in other context and extract features from them or retrain them with a small dataset related to the specific application (fine-tuning). We propose to fine-tuning an ensemble of models combined together from multiple pretrained CNNs (AlexNet, VGG19 and GoogleNet). We test our approach on three different benchmark datasets: Yahoo! Shopping Shoe Image Content, UC Merced Land Use Dataset, and Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset. Each one represents a different application. Our suggested approach always improves accuracy over the state of the art solutions and accuracy obtained by the returning of a single CNN. In the best case, we moved from accuracy of 70.5% to 93.14%.","tags":[],"title":"Convolutional Neural Network Ensemble Fine-Tuning for Extended Transfer Learning.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mikel Joaristi","Edoardo Serra","Francesca Spezzano"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1476748800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1476748800,"objectID":"9726f97388a3b39e9481e4d4d166829f","permalink":"https://mjoaristi.github.io/publication/identifying-health-violating-restaurants-with-online-reviews/","publishdate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/identifying-health-violating-restaurants-with-online-reviews/","section":"publication","summary":"Nowadays, detecting health-violating restaurants is a serious problem due to the limited number of health inspectors in a city as compared to the number of restaurants.
